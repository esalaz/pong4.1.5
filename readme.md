This project has been very stressful It seemed overwheming when scripts began to break and things we're going my way.
I decided to tackle both the about me section as well as the game. This ended up being scrabble to produce either or when issues plagued both ends.
My final solution is now pong. Followed by a small about me section. I struggled with all the material and ended up having to use comments thoughout my javascript and css to not get lost.

Technologies I used:
I worked mostly with vanilla javascript. I felt that I was not comfortable enough with it to simply move on to jquery so I struggled through much of it.

I worked with the requestAnimationFrame method to create the canvas and element inside my pong clone.

In really I hopped to do so much more which took so much more time. I have to push those extra features for now but hope to add music to the start of the game as well as attempting to use music beats as a variable to control the speed of the balls movement.

For the nav I used a simple nav using bootstrap, simply added the nav and nav-tabs class to change the styling.

For my about me I attemped to use the parallax css property to display images to showcase myself.
